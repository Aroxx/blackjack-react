# Let's Play Blackjack

This is a re-write of my 2015 cult classic ["Let's Play Blackjack!"](https://github.com/Aroxx/blackjack-game) using React instead of jQuery.

I'm using [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/) for my buttons and layout. This is my first time using it and I like how easy it is to install and add Bootstrap styled components.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
